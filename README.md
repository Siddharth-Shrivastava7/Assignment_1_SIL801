1. code_dprepare.py file is use to create image data folders.
2. main.py file contains custom dataloader function for train and val sets. 

Note:
In custom dataloader, I haven't used different transforms functions in train data, we can modify that 
once the full code is prepared. 


Dataset: 
Original dataset folder which contains 10 folers plus X(don't care) - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q0jgTxFxfRcjH_bmmRld5jB4uv2z4FEm/view?usp=sharing
